# Loading soil data in R

The main study cases are:

- Text file format
- Spatial file format
- Database (spatial or not)
 
`sf`, `sp`, `aqp`

## Loading CSV files

`readr`

## Loading soil observations as spatial data

`sp` and `sf`

## The case of databases

`st_read`, `dplyr` + SQLite 

# Analysing soil data in R: first steps with AQP

## Data structures for soil profile data 

General idea behind SPC

## Creation of `SoilProfileCollection`s

`depths()<-`

## Visualisation of `SoilProfileCollection`s

`plotSPC`

## Aggregation of `SoilProfileCollection`s

`slab`
